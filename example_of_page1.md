## 🧠 Real-World Example: **Building a Personal Budget Tracker App**

Let’s call it: **“SaveMate”** — it helps users track expenses and savings.

---

### 🔹 1. **Programming Languages**

You write the app:

* **Java** for backend logic (calculations, user login).
* **HTML/CSS/JS** or **React** for the frontend interface.
* **SQL** to store and fetch expenses from a database.

🛠️ Example:

```java
totalSpending = food + bills + shopping;
```

---

### 🔹 2. **Algorithms & Data Structures**

You need logic to:

* Show top 3 biggest expenses.
* Sort expenses by date or amount.

🛠️ You use:

* **Arrays, Lists** to store expenses.
* **Sorting algorithm** to rank them.

---

### 🔹 3. **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**

You follow steps:

1. Talk to users – they want expense tracking.
2. Design screens (add expense, view report).
3. Code the app.
4. Test for bugs.
5. Launch on Play Store.
6. Keep improving based on feedback.

---

### 🔹 4. **Version Control**

You use **Git** to:

* Save code versions.
* Work with friends safely.
* Undo mistakes if something breaks.

🛠️ Commands:

```bash
git init  
git commit -m "added expense calculator"
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Debugging & Testing**

You find and fix:

* Bug: App crashes if amount is negative.
* Fix: Add a check before saving.

🛠️ Use tools like:

* Print logs, Unit tests.

---

### 🔹 6. **Databases**

You store:

* User info.
* Expense records (date, category, amount).

🛠️ Use **MySQL or SQLite**.
Example table:

| Date       | Category | Amount |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| 2025-07-01 | Food     | 500    |

---

### 🔹 7. **Operating Systems**

You run your app on:

* **Android (Linux-based)** or deploy backend to **Linux server**.

Know about:

* File systems to read/write logs.
* Memory usage so app doesn’t crash.

---

### 🔹 8. **Networking Basics**

If user logs in or syncs data to the cloud:

* Your app talks to server via **HTTP**.
* Data is sent via **APIs**.

---

### 🔹 9. **Cloud Computing**

If you store data online:

* Use **Firebase or AWS**.
* Host backend on **EC2**, store reports on **S3**.

---

### 🔹 10. **CI/CD**

You automate:

* Every time you update code, it gets tested and deployed using tools like **GitHub Actions**.

No need to manually upload code every time!

---

### 🔹 11. **Security Practices**

You protect users by:

* Encrypting passwords.
* Validating inputs so no one can break your database.

---

### 🔹 12. **Software Architecture**

You decide:

* Split logic: Auth module, Expense module.
* Use **REST APIs** to send/receive data.

🧠 Keeps your app clean and organized.

---

### 🔹 13. **Problem-Solving**

Challenge:

* How to alert users if they overspend?

You build:

* A function that checks monthly limit and shows warning.

---

### 🔹 14. **Communication**

You explain:

* How the app works to friends or team.
* Write simple docs or videos.

---

### 🔹 15. **Project Management**

You track:

* Features to build.
* Bugs to fix.

Use **Notion, Trello, or a notebook** to stay organized.

---

## ✅ Summary:

Even something small like a **Budget App** uses almost all of these 16 skills — just at a simpler level.
